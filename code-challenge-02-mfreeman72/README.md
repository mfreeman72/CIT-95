## Code Challenge 02 for CIT-95 ##
This code challenge will test your understanding of all the following Python concepts that we have covered so far in CIT-95:
Data types, decision and repetition control structures, data structures (arrays), Boolean type, exception handling, sentinel flags, break statements, type coercion and casting, and program logic. 

Complete this code challenge successfully and you will be ready for the midterm program! 

Do not copy and paste this code challenge. Read the code, study the concepts that you need help with, discuss with your lab partner, and create a coding plan -- what do you need to create to accoumplish the program specs? Code up this challenge from your code plan and refer to this assignment as an approved solution when you get stuck. Be able to explain all todos to me (you will do this for the midterm program during your midterm code review). Complete all the basic todos and as many advanced todos as you can before the deadline of Oct 2.

Your program should be concise, but not cryptic. Use comments, snake_style, and proper indentation to make your code self documenting. Your program should be no longer than 50 lines with verbose comments -- maybe a bit longer if you do the advanced todo using file IO.

Work with your lab partner on this challenge. Use your personal GitHub account and create a public repo that I can see. After reviewing this code challenge, I will publish the midterm program specs which will include arrays, lists, file IO, and string slicing. it will be creating a zoo with habitats for lions, tigers, and bears.

As always, contact me on Canvas if you need help and I will schedule a Zoom call with you and your lab partner.

Good luck!
