# fileSearch.py

#
#  In this code challenge you will search an email file and list all the senders of all email messages. Email format
#  is prefix@domain. For example: firstlast99@gmail.com -- firstlast99 is the prefix and gmail.com is the domain. For
#  this program, you will call the prefix@domain the sender. Your Python program will use split() to parse the
#  prefix and domain and a Python dictionary to tabulate the number of email messages received from each prefix. For
#  this code challenge, consider prefix segments to uniquely identify each sender. Output your dictionary in many
#  ways: natural state (this could be any order and could be changed by your program (not by you)), values sorted
#  by value, keys sorted by keys, items sorted by vale and key, ascending and descending.
#  Advanced: Produce output that tabulates prefix@domain (does not parse into two parts) sends and use the
#  dictionary get() method to replace the if/else stmt. Explain how the get() method works and saves you from
#  writing code!

# Open a file, read the file line by line and search for lines that begin with "From " (note the space after
# "From"). Lines that begin with "From:" (note the colon after "From" ) do not contain the sender.
#   1) Count the number of found lines and output the count.
#   2) Use split() to parse the line into separate words.
#   3) Use the second word as the email sender.
#   4) Output the email sender.
#   5) Use split('@') to parse the prefix and domain
#   6) Output the email sender's prefix and domain
