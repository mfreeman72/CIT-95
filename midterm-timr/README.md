Midterm Code Challenge for Python

#  In this code challenge you will search an email file and list all the senders of all email messages. Email format
#  is prefix@domain. For example: firstlast99@gmail.com -- firstlast99 is the prefix and gmail.com is the domain. For
#  this program, you will call the prefix@domain the sender. Your Python program will use split() to parse the
#  prefix and domain and a Python dictionary to tabulate the number of email messages received from each prefix. For
#  this code challenge, consider prefix segments to uniquely identify each sender. Output your dictionary in many
#  ways: natural state (this could be any order and could be changed by your program (not by you)), values sorted
#  by value, keys sorted by keys, items sorted by vale and key, ascending and descending.
#  Advanced: Produce output that tabulates prefix@domain (does not parse into two parts) sends and use the
#  dictionary get() method to replace the if/else stmt. Explain how the get() method works and saves you from
#  writing code!

Make this code your own -- code it, change it, break it, code it again!
